<div class='paragraph'>
<p><strong>Terms and Conditions for the supply of Waterstones products</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your details</strong></p>
<p>a. When you register with the Waterstones website, you will be required to choose a contact email 
address and password. You are responsible for all sessions and transactions 
taken under these details. You should keep your password safe and not 
disclose it to anyone. You should change it immediately if you feel 
it has been compromised.</p>
<p>b. If any of your details change, 
such as your credit card billing address, you must inform Waterstones 
as soon as possible. You may update your details by signing into your 
account on the Waterstones website, and update the relevant section.
</p>
<p><strong>The contract between us</strong></p>
<p>a. Any contract for purchases 
made through the website will be with Waterstones Booksellers Limited, 
whose registered office is situated at Capital Court, Capital Interchange Way, Brentford, Middlesex, TW8 0EX, 
company registration number 610095 (Waterstones).</p>
<p>b. Waterstones must receive 
payment of the whole of the price for the goods that you order before 
your order can be accepted, and the contract formed. Payment is not 
taken until the point of despatch of the goods to you from our distribution 
centre. Once payment has been received Waterstones will confirm that 
your order has been received by sending an email to you at the email 
address you provide in your registration form. The shipment email will 
include your name, the order number and the total price. Waterstones 
acceptance of your order brings into existence a legally binding contract 
between us on these terms. Any term sought to be imposed by you in your 
order will not form part of the contract.</p>
<p>c. Waterstones are entitled 
to withdraw from any contract in the case of obvious errors or inaccuracies 
regarding the goods appearing on our website. If an error or inaccuracy 
is discovered with regards to the advertised price of the goods that 
you have ordered, we will contact you as soon as possible by email. 
This will be to inform you of the correct price of the goods, and to 
ask you if you wish to continue with the order at the amended price, 
or to cancel the order altogether.</p>
<p><strong>Withdrawal by you from the 
contract</strong></p>
</div>
<div class='paragraph'>
<p>If you are an individual and 
are not buying goods on behalf of a business, there are certain circumstances 
in which you may withdraw from the contract and these are set out here. 
This right to withdraw does not apply to business buyers.</p>
<p>a. You may withdraw your order 
for goods at any time up to the end of the twenty first working day 
after you have received the goods. You do not need to give Waterstones 
any reason for withdrawing your order nor will you have to pay any penalty.</p>
<p>b. The only circumstance in 
which you cannot withdraw your order is where you have taken the goods 
you have ordered (or the ones in relation to which you want to withdraw) 
out of the sealed package in which they were delivered.</p>
<p>c. To withdraw your order you 
must notify Waterstones in writing at the address set out in the <a href='returning-items'>
Waterstones returns section of this website.</a></p>
<p>d. If you have received the 
goods before you withdraw your order then, unless you have lost your 
right to withdraw because you have taken the goods out of their sealed 
package, you must send them back to the Waterstones return address 
at your own cost and risk, (or a local Waterstones store) unless 
the goods were supplied faulty or damaged. If you withdraw your order 
but Waterstones has already processed the goods for delivery and 
you have received them, you must not unpack the goods when they are 
received by you and you must send the goods back to Waterstones at 
the Waterstones return address at your own cost and risk as soon 
as possible.</p>
<p>e. Once you have notified Waterstones 
that you are withdrawing your order, any sum debited to Waterstones 
from your credit card will be re-credited to your account as soon as 
possible and in any event within 30 days of your order.
</p>
<p><strong>Availability of goods you 
order</strong></p>
<p>If Waterstones has insufficient 
stock to deliver the goods ordered by you, we will notify you as soon 
as possible and any sum debited by Waterstones from your credit card 
will be re-credited to your account and Waterstones will notify you 
by email at the address given by you in your order form. The refund 
will be made as soon as possible and in any event within 30 days of 
your order. Waterstones will not be obliged to offer any additional 
compensation for disappointment suffered.</p>
<p>Please note: we endeavour to 
bring our customers the best value we can by running special offers, 
but please remember stocks are limited at the special offer price, and 
subject to availability. We update our website as quickly as we can 
to minimise disappointment. The process of updating the website when 
goods have sold out at promotional price can take a few hours to update. 
Please note that the price the goods are offered for tender are as displayed 
in the Shopping Basket. Rest assured your credit card will only be debited 
as your order or individual items from your order are dispatched.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-buy offers</strong></p>
<p>Prices exclude postage and packing. Promotions apply to listed titles only, which are subject to change and availability. If you choose to purchase a product from a multi-buy offer, but do not purchase enough products to qualify for the special discount, the product will be charged at the normal price. Please note that on 3 for 2 promotions (and other multi-buy offers), the lowest priced title will always be the 'free' item. </p>
<p><strong>Delivery of goods to you</strong></p>
<p>a. Waterstones will post, 
or arrange a courier on your behalf, for the goods ordered by you to 
the person and address you give Waterstones at the time you make 
your order. For goods delivered outside of the EU, the consignee (ie the person to whom the consignment is 
sent) will be the declarant and importer into the country for which 
the consignment is destined. The consignee 
will be responsible for both customs clearance and payment of customs 
duties and local taxes where required.  </p>
<p>b. Delivery will be made as 
soon as possible after your order is accepted and in any event within 
30 days of despatch of the order. All delivery times quoted on the website are estimates only, based on availability, normal processing and 
delivery companies.</p>
<p>c. You will become the owner 
of the goods you have ordered when the goods are despatched to you from 
our distribution centre.</p>
<p><strong>Customs charges</strong></p>
<p>If you are ordering goods for 
delivery outside of the EU, please note that your consignment may be 
subject to import duties and taxes, which are levied once the goods 
reach the country of destination. Any such charges levied in relation 
to customs clearance must be borne by you. It is accepted by you that 
Waterstones has no control over additional charges in relation to 
customs clearance. Waterstones recommend that you check with your 
local customs officials or post office for more information regarding 
importation taxes/duties that may be applicable to your online order.
</p>
<p><strong>Liability</strong></p>
<p>This is as follows:</p>
<p>a. If the goods Waterstones  
delivers are not what you ordered or are damaged or defective or the 
delivery is of an incorrect quantity, Waterstones shall have no liability 
to you unless you notify Waterstones of the problem, in writing to <a href='mailto:service@waterstones.com'><strong>service@waterstones.com</strong></a> within 10 working days of the delivery 
of goods in question.</p>
<p>b. If you do not receive goods 
ordered by you within 30 days of the date on which they were despatched 
to you, Waterstones shall have no liability to you unless you notify 
Waterstones in writing at the Waterstones contact address of the 
problem within 40 days of the date on which the goods were despatched 
to you.</p>
</div> 
<div class='paragraph'>
<p>c. If you notify a problem 
to Waterstones under this condition, Waterstones only obligation 
will be, at its option, to make good any shortage or non-delivery; 
to replace or repair any goods that are damaged or defective; or to 
refund to you the amount paid by you for the goods in question to the 
original method of payment, unless such method is no longer valid in 
which case Waterstones e-coupons will be issued to the value of the 
refund due.</p>
<p>d. Waterstones will not 
be liable to you for any indirect or consequential loss or damage arising 
out of any problem you notify to Waterstones under this condition 
and Waterstones shall have no liability to pay any money to you by 
way of compensation other than to refund to you the amount paid by you 
for the goods in question under paragraph (c) above.</p>
<p>e. Nothing in this condition 
is, however, intended to limit any rights you might have as a consumer 
under applicable local law that may not be excluded nor in any way to 
exclude or limit Waterstones liability to you for any death or personal
